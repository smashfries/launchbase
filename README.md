# About

This is the app for Launch Base - a new community-based Startup platform centered around founders and builders, to give them the ideal environment to go from idea to 1000+ users. Our goals:

- to create an environment to foster healthy debates and discussions to help founders validate their ideas
- allow founders to create communities of early adopters and loyal fans who eagerly await to hear about the company's progress
- give founders access to a large pool of talent that is eager to work for a startup in exchange for reasonable financial compensation or equity
- provide numerous discounts and offers to tools and aid development of the product

The project is currently in development, and I am the sole developer. If you are interested in the idea and would like to join Launch Base, please shoot me an email at aditya@adityaone.com

# Technical details

This is a Node.js application built using Fastify. MongoDB is used as the primary database along with Redis for authentication. Current plan is to containerize the app using Docker and deploy it on GCP using Cloud Run.
